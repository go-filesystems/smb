// have talked both sides down to a weaker dialect. Once the session exists, the
// client asks the server to repeat what it said -- signed this time -- and
// compares. Windows treats a failure as an attack and drops the connection, so
// "not implemented" is not a safe answer for it the way it is for the rest.
//
// The answer must be what was actually negotiated, which is why the server's
// GUID is fixed for its lifetime and the client's own numbers are remembered.
