// Who may use a share, and for what.
//
// Until this existed, every authenticated user got every share with full
// access: a server with two people on it could not keep one out of the
// other's images. That is a surprise rather than a missing feature, which is
// why it is a refusal now and not a note in the documentation.
//
// Three rules, and they compose:
//
//	allow    empty  -> anyone who authenticated may connect
//	allow    listed -> only those named may connect, everyone else is refused
//	writers  empty  -> whoever may connect may write, unless ReadOnly
//	writers  listed -> only those named may write; the rest get a read-only
//	                   share, told to them in the access mask at connect time
//	ReadOnly        -> nobody writes, whatever writers says
//
// The mask matters as much as the refusal: a client told read-only greys the
// actions out, and a person sees why. A client told it may write, whose writes
// are then refused one at a time, sees a broken share.

// AllowUsers names the only users who may connect to this share. Called more
// than once, the names accumulate.

// the same share at once with different answers.
